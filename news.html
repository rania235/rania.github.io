  <h1>Habitat for Humanity of Berkeley County and
    Thrivent partner to help improve the lives of
    Hanahan family </h1>

  <p class="txt">Habitat for Humanity of Berkeley County and Thrivent have partnered
    together with local churches and Thrivent members in Hanahan to make
    a difference for the Evans' family. Habitat for Humanity of Berkeley County
    has been awarded $50,829 from Thrivent as part of the long-standing national
    partnership between Habitat and Thrivent, which helps families achieve strength,
    stability, and self-reliance through affordable housing.

    Locally, Habitat and Thrivent will partner on the construction of a home for
    a local family in Hanahan alongside multiple local churches in a Habitat and
    Thrivent Faith Builds. Over 80 of these home build projects will take place
    across the US.

    “Faith without works is dead.” -James 2:14-26. Please join us in showing our faith
    is working by sharing our love for our fellow man with the Thrivent Financial - Berkeley
    County Habitat for Humanity - Faith Build.” Adam Thayer, Thrivent Financial Professional

  <p class="text1">Habitat and Thrivent Faith Builds improve communities by helping Habitat build
    homes in partnership with Christian churches and families in need of decent,
    affordable housing in the US.

    Thrivent has committed to partner with Habitat, future homeowner families,
    Christian churches, and volunteers across the US and around the world on
    different housing projects.

    Since the national partnership’s inception in 2005 Thrivent and its members
    have contributed more than $252 million and more than 5.5 million volunteer
    hours in the U.S. and around the world to help thousands of families and
    individuals build strength, stability, and self-reliance through shelter.

    “We are truly grateful to have again been awarded the Thrivent Faith Build Grant.
    Thrivent Financial has not only been our largest single supporter over the last
    29 years but also the largest non-government supporter of Habitat for Humanity
    International. Their investment in affordable housing around the world has
    allowed Habitat for Humanity to serve thousands of people in need. We are
    looking forward to the partnership with Thrivent and the faith community
    to serve another family in Berkeley County,” George Druyos, CEO & President
    of Habitat for Humanity of Berkeley County.

    Thrivent remains the largest non-governmental supporter of Habitat for Humanity
    International.
