  <h1 class="title">COMMUNITY HABITAT</h1>
  <p class="text">Habitat for Humanity International is a nonprofit
    Christian organization that partners with future and
    current homeowners to build safe, decent, and affordable
    homes for working families. The affiliate, volunteers, and
    future homeowners work together through the homeownership process.
    Homes are sold at no profit, meaning the homeowner does not pay additional
    fees. The homeowners only pays what it costs to build the home.
    Habitat for Humanity International hopes to expand their model to create
    communities in which everyone has a safe, decent, affordable home. </p>
