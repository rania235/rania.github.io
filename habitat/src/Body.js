        Habitat for Humanity International is a nonprofit Christian organization
        that partners with future and current homeowners to build safe, decent,
        and affordable homes for working families. The affiliate, volunteers,
        and future homeowners work together through the homeownership process.
        Homes are sold at no profit, meaning the homeowner does not pay
        additional fees. The homeowners only pays what it costs to build the
        home. Habitat for Humanity International hopes to expand their model to
        create communities in which everyone has a safe, decent, affordable
        home.{" "}
