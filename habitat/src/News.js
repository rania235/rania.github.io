        Habitat and Thrivent Faith Builds improve communities by helping Habitat
        build homes in partnership with Christian churches and families in need
        of decent, affordable housing in the US. Thrivent has committed to
        partner with Habitat, future homeowner families, Christian churches, and
        volunteers across the US and around the world on different housing
        projects. Since the national partnership’s inception in 2005 Thrivent
        and its members have contributed more than $252 million and more than
        5.5 million volunteer hours in the U.S. and around the world to help
        thousands of families and individuals build strength, stability, and
        self-reliance through shelter. “We are truly grateful to have again been
        awarded the Thrivent Faith Build Grant. Thrivent Financial has not only
        been our largest single supporter over the last 29 years but also the
        largest non-government supporter of Habitat for Humanity International.
        Their investment in affordable housing around the world has allowed
        Habitat for Humanity to serve thousands of people in need. We are
        looking forward to the partnership with Thrivent and the faith community
        to serve another family in Berkeley County,” George Druyos, CEO &
        President of Habitat for Humanity of Berkeley County. Thrivent remains
        the largest non-governmental supporter of Habitat for Humanity
        International. For more information about the Habitat and Thrivent
